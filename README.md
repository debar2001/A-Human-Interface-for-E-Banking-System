Project Title: A Human Interface for E-Banking System.

This was a group project for the course CSE4015- Human Computer Interaction. This project was developed by Debargha Guha Neogi, Ankit Kumar, Badhan Paul and Jitesh Mudgal.

We developed a website for an imaginary bank named "Bank of Vellore" for the customers who are new to the E-Banking services as is the case with many people in rural India. They don't know too much about the nuances of E-Banking, so cannot use most of the services but we provided info-boxes for each and every menu button, so that they can use all the services efficiently.

We prepared a tutorial or help video for the same which is uploaded on youtube.

We used basic HTML, CSS and JS for the front-end development.
We used PHP for back-end development and MySQL for the databases.


The code is in the master branch of this repository.
