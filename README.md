Project Title: A Human Interface for E-Banking System.

We created different files for different functionalities.

The canvas.js file is responsible for the background oscillating sin wave with colour oscillations which was implemented using Object-Oriented JS, event handlers and a dat.gui repository.
We have a check.js for checking credentials whether they are filled in proper way or not for which we used the concept of regular expressions.

The different php files which also include html were created for different functionalities of an E-Banking System.

The welcomestyle.css file was developed for adding style sheet to the welcome page which is a bit different than other pages.
The transferstyle.css file contains style elements for all the other html & php files

We implemented the OTP services, where a user gets an email of the OTP to be filled from the bank's email id, sent automatically using the SMTP protocol for that you have to configure te php.ini and sentmail.ini files and also set up the mercury services provided by the XAMPP server solution stack package.
