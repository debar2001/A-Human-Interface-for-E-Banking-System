Project Title: A Human Interface for E-Banking System.

We created different files for different functionalities.

The canvas.js file is responsible for the background oscillating sin wave with colour oscillations which was implemented using Object-Oriented JS, event handlers and a dat.gui repository.
We have a check.js for checking credentials whether they are filled in proper way or not for which we used the concept of regular expressions.

The different php files which also include html were created for different functionalities of an E-Banking System.

The welcome.css file was developed for adding style sheet to the welcome page which is a bit different than other pages.
